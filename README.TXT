Part III:

#43 It will only add the value if the key inputted is absent. Basically it will check to see if the key is there
    and will only input the value if that key isn't a duplicate.

#45 In the responder, add a method that will loop through every key in the 
    responseMap and then in the wordcounter add an if statement saying to 
    only add the word to the word count if the word is not found in the 
    Map using the method created to loop trough it.

#46 It is accurate and complete, it names each class its function and its methods
    in detail except the ones added by me. No errors found.

#47 Special comment formatting for description of what the class does:
     /**
     * Create a WordCounter
     */
    Description for the purpose of the parameter:
    @param 

#48 @return : Specifies return type and describes it.
    @version : Holds current version number of the program. 
    @author : Holds the name of the author of the program.
